# The reference reagent robot is the one I debug my software on, so I list the materials here:
1. DFRobot Devastator Tank Mobile Platform.  For people want to buy one, here is a [purchase link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=44673299047&_u=3bdbs2de0c), I purchase the upgraded version which use metal motor component.  Note: I don't have affiliance with any purchase link I posted here.
2. DFRobot RoMeo V2 controller.  This is the bottom half controller that drive the wheel and also the servo that position the camera. [purchase link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=18955799709&_u=3bdbs2f468)
3. GY-89 10DOF, a 10DOF module with LSM303D+L3GD20+BMP180, [purchase link](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=42362578979&spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&_u=3bdbs2495e).  You can choose other model but the program in bottom half work with this model.
4. Intel Joule 570x with expansion board.
5. Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick.
6. Fish eye camera.  I don't mean camera with distortion.  I mean camera with true 2\pi (180 degree) FOV.  I choose this SY019HD which proves to cover the disired field, and lens looks superior.   [purchase link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=535947099245&_u=3bdbs2257b).  I buy the USB version without case, and I asked shop owner to use shorter cable (50cm will be enough).
7. DC-DC, anything can output 11v and 5v with 25W will do.  I choose [this](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=17230263235&_u=3bdbs24466) DFRobot DC-DC module.  You need two of them, one to power the Romeo, wheel, and servos, the other one to power Joule 570x.   The model I choose can be fixed at 5V output or a var voltage output with a screwdriver.
8. thermal fan to put on the Joule 570x module to keep the tempreture down.   I used an 1 inch 5v fan.  You can also choose to build termal solution according to Joule 570x manual.
9. 12v lithon [purchase link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=37502434824&_u=3bdbs20f63)  You need to pay attention to the dimension.  The model I purchase overly fit a little but I use a strap to keep it in place.
10. USB HUB, [here](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=548714131763&spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&_u=3bdbs218a5&sku_properties=148242406:40233957) is a 3 port USB hub sit neatly on top of the battery I purchase
11. RDS3115 servo, [purchase link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=521728033704&_u=3bdbs23ef6), I purchase the 270 degree with 17kg model.  Choose the standard U shape case (suite 1).  This is the one to put camera on
12. DS3115 servo, [purchase link](https://buyertrade.taobao.com/trade/itemlist/list_bought_items.htm?spm=2013.1.1997525045.2.4b556901pIkyqF), I choose the 270 degree with metal plate.
13. Servo case, [purchase link](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.2ed6e797NI8ZMR&id=530797376820&_u=3bdbs2255a), this one is used to mount the DS3115 servo
14. You need some connectors, let me fill in the details later
